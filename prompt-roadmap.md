Objective:
You are the lead architect for our application, "Career Quest." Your task is to understand and then build the core AI-powered curriculum generation system. This is the most innovative feature of our app. This document will explain the complete philosophy, the two-part structure, and the user flow for this system.

Part 1: The Core Philosophy - The "AI Mentor"
Before we discuss the implementation, you must understand the core idea. We are not building a simple list of courses. We are building an AI Mentor. The system's goal is to replicate the wisdom and guidance of a panel of seasoned industry professionals. It must feel personal, intelligent, and deeply practical.

To achieve this, the system operates in two distinct, powerful phases:

Phase 1: The "AI Architect"

This AI acts as a high-level mentor planning the user's entire career journey from a bird's-eye view. Its job is to create the Career Roadmap.

Phase 2: The "AI Tutor"

This AI acts as an expert, hands-on teacher for one specific subject. Its job is to create the detailed Course Roadmap (the curriculum) for a single lesson node.

This two-phase approach is critical. It allows us to generate a comprehensive, long-term plan for the user upfront, but then create the deep, detailed course content just-in-time, right when the user needs it. This is efficient, scalable, and ensures the content is always fresh.

Part 2: The Career Roadmap (The "Macro" View)
The Idea:
The Career Roadmap is the user's main home screen. It's a visual, gamified representation of their entire learning journey for their chosen career (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer").

The Design:

We will implement a Duolingo-style winding path. This is a single, continuous, vertically scrolling path with interactive nodes placed along it. It must be visually engaging and motivating.

The Structure (Generated by the "AI Architect"):
The AI Architect's job is to generate a JSON object that defines the sequence and type of every node on this path. The structure must be logical and comprehensive, including:

Units: The path is broken into logical "Units" or "Stages" (e.g., "Unit 1: The Foundations," "Unit 2: Core Skills").

Course Nodes: These are the primary, clickable lessons.

Project Nodes: These are major capstone projects that appear after a user has completed a Unit of courses.

Reward Nodes ("Fruits"): These are special nodes that appear after major achievements and contain rewards like badges or motivational quotes.

Final Stage Nodes: The path must conclude with dedicated nodes for "Interview Prep" and advanced "Upskilling."

Part 3: The Course Roadmap (The "Micro" View)
The Idea:
The Course Roadmap is the detailed curriculum for one single Course Node. When a user clicks on "HTML & CSS Deep Dive" in their Career Roadmap, this is the detailed syllabus they see.

The Philosophy (The NxtWave Model):
The content for each course must be as rich and effective as a premium EdTech course from a platform like NxtWave. This means it is not just a list of videos. It is a complete learning loop. The "AI Tutor" must generate a curriculum that includes:

A logical sequence of Lectures.

For each Lecture:

A link to a high-quality YouTube video.

A detailed Cheat Sheet. This is the most critical component. It is a "super-summary" that recaps the video's concepts but also adds 20-30% more information, including pro-tips, detailed examples, and warnings about common pitfalls a real professional would give.

A Quiz (10-20 questions) to test understanding.

Practical Tasks placed between lectures to apply the knowledge.

The course must conclude with a comprehensive Final Revision Sheet and a Final Exam.

Part 4: The Connection & The User Flow
This is how the two roadmaps connect in the application:

A user selects their career goal (e.g., "AI Developer").

The "AI Architect" is called once. It generates the entire Career Roadmap structure (the sequence of all the nodes for the winding path). This JSON is saved to our database.

The frontend uses this JSON to render the visual Duolingo-style path, with most nodes shown as "locked."

The user clicks on their first active Course Node (e.g., "HTML Fundamentals").

Now, the "AI Tutor" is called just-in-time. It takes the title of that single node and generates the complete, detailed Course Roadmap (the full curriculum with videos, cheat sheets, quizzes, etc.).

The frontend uses this new JSON to build the "Course Dashboard" page, the "Video Lecture" page, the "Cheat Sheet" page, and the "Test" pages for that specific course.

When the user completes this course, the next node on the main Career Roadmap unlocks, and the process repeats.

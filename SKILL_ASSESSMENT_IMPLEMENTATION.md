# Skill Assessment and Learning Path Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the skill assessment and learning path features for the Career Advisor application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Skill Assessment
- **Component**: `src/components/mobile/SkillAssessment.tsx`
- **Page**: `src/app/skill-assessment/page.tsx`
- **Service**: `src/lib/skillAssessment.ts`
- **API Route**: `src/app/api/skill-assessment/route.ts`

The skill assessment feature allows users to evaluate their current proficiency in their chosen career field through a series of yes/no questions followed by an open-ended response about their experience.

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis
- Uses Google Generative AI to analyze user responses
- Provides personalized assessment including:
  - Skill level determination (0-4 scale)
  - Strength identification
  - Areas for improvement
  - Learning path starting level
  - Prerequisite recommendations

### 3. Learning Path Generation
- **Component**: `src/components/mobile/LearningPathDisplay.tsx`
- **Page**: `src/app/learning-path/page.tsx`
- **Service**: `src/lib/learningPath.ts`

Generates a personalized learning path based on the user's skill assessment results.

## Integration Points

# Career Advisor

A language-smart, zero-cost LMS that lives entirely in-app and turns any learner into a job-ready professional.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 14 application that implements the core workflow of the Career Advisor platform:

1. Google OAuth authentication (simplified for demo)
2. Native language selection (Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi)
3. Career goal setting (already set vs. discovery through psychology questions)
4. AI-powered career recommendations using Google Gemini
5. Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and enhanced animations

## üî• Firebase Status Update

**Important Notice**: The Firebase backend is currently experiencing connectivity issues. The app gracefully degrades to sample data mode when Firebase is unavailable. All features remain functional with the following limitations:

- User responses are stored locally (lost on refresh)
- Recommendations use sample data instead of real algorithms
- Progress is not persisted across sessions

See [FIREBASE_STATUS.md](FIREBASE_STATUS.md) for detailed information and troubleshooting steps.

## ‚ú® AI-Powered Features

The Career Advisor now includes AI-powered career recommendations using Google Gemini:

1. **Dynamic Career Persona Generation**: Based on psychology quiz answers, the AI creates a unique career persona for each user
2. **Personalized Role Recommendations**: The AI recommends 5 specific job roles that match the user's persona
3. **Detailed Role Information**: For each recommended role, the AI generates comprehensive information including:
   - Role description
   - Daily responsibilities
   - Salary ranges
   - Career progression paths
   - Required skills
   - Educational requirements
   - Job market outlook

   - Add your Firebase configuration values
   - Add your Google Gemini API key

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Testing AI Features

To test the AI-powered features:

1. Visit `/check-env` to verify your environment variables are properly configured
2. Visit `/test-gemini` to test the Google Gemini API connectivity
3. Visit `/test-ai-service` to test the AI recommendations service
4. Complete the full user flow in the main application to see AI-generated recommendations

## Hackathon Progress

This project was created for a hackathon with the goal of building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates the core value proposition of Career Advisor. The current implementation includes:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Google OAuth login
2. **Onboarding**: Language selection and goal setting
3. **Psychology Quiz**: Complete 10-question quiz for career discovery
4. **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Personalized career personas and role recommendations
5. **Role Deep-Dive**: Detailed information about recommended career paths

The next steps for the hackathon would be to implement:
1. Goal validation for users with existing goals
2. Skill assessment component
3. Learning path system
4. Gamification elements

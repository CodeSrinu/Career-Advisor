# Career Advisor - Skill Test Questions

## Skill Test Framework

The skill test consists of 15 questions to assess the user's current proficiency level in their chosen domain.

## Sample Questions (Front-End Development Focus)

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {"q": "Have you written any HTML file?"},
    {"q": "Have you used CSS Flexbox or Grid?"},
    {"q": "Have you used JavaScript variables or loops?"},
    {"q": "Have you used Git for version control?"},
    {"q": "Have you debugged browser DevTools?"},
    {"q": "Have you created responsive layouts?"},
    {"q": "Have you used npm or yarn?"},
    {"q": "Have you built a React/Vue/Angular component?"},
    {"q": "Have you consumed a REST API in code?"},
    {"q": "Have you written unit tests?"},
    {"q": "Have you deployed a site to GitHub Pages/Netlify?"},
    {"q": "Have you used a CSS preprocessor (Sass, PostCSS)?"},

    {"q": "Have you participated in a front-end project with â‰¥2 people?"}
  ]
}
```

## Open Response Question

**Prompt:** Describe what you have done so far related to Front-End Dev (projects, courses, tools, links).

This open-ended question allows users to provide context about their experience and showcase any relevant work they've completed.

## Scoring & Difficulty Mapping

Based on the skill test results, users are placed into one of three difficulty levels:

1. **Beginner (0-5 questions correct)**: Prerequisite micro-course needed
2. **Intermediate (6-10 questions correct)**: Direct entry to Level 1 content
3. **Advanced (11-15 questions correct)**: Direct entry to Level 3 content

## Adaptive Learning Path

The skill test results determine:
- Which prerequisite micro-course (if any) the user needs
- Which level of the main curriculum the user starts with
- What types of hands-on tasks will be most appropriate
- How much scaffolding is needed in early lessons

This ensures each learner starts at the right difficulty level without being overwhelmed or bored.

You are an expert UI/UX designer with a specialization in creating engaging and user-friendly educational platforms.

Your task is to generate a complete UI/UX design guide for a new mobile-first web application called "Career Quest."

**Application Context:**
- **Product:** An AI-powered "Personalized Career & Skills Advisor" for college students in India.
- **Goal:** To help users discover their passions and build a clear, gamified learning path toward a job.
- **Target Audience:** Indian students (ages 18-24), who may be anxious or uncertain about their future.
- **Desired Vibe:** Encouraging, clear, modern, trustworthy, and motivating. Avoid a corporate or overly formal feel.

**Required Output:**
Generate the guide in three distinct sections:

**1. Core Design Principles:**
   List and briefly explain 4-5 fundamental principles that should guide every design decision for this app.

**2. UI/UX Dos and Don'ts:**
   Create a markdown table with two columns: "Do ✅" and "Don't ❌". Provide at least 5 clear, actionable points in each column, covering aspects like navigation, language, feedback, and user flow.

**3. Brand Color Themes:**
   Suggest 5 distinct color themes suitable for the app's brand. For each theme, provide:
   - A creative name (e.g., "Deep Focus Blue").
   - A primary, secondary, and accent color with their hex codes.
   - A brief description of the psychological feeling or "vibe" the theme evokes.

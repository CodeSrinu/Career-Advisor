    * 1: Novice (Has theoretical knowledge but little practical application)
    * 2: Apprentice (Has completed some small projects or courses)
    * 3: Advanced (Has solid practical experience and can work independently)

2.  **Identify Strengths:** Based on their positive answers and project descriptions, identify 1-2 key "Strengths." These are the skills they can already build upon.
